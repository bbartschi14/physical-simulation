# physical-simulation

An OpenGL scene for physical simulation, including 
- Circular motion
- Structural spring pendulum
- Cloth

Created for MIT course 6.837.

## Running the program

`cloth_sim.exe` can be run in the terminal with two command line parameters that define the integrator (e, t, or r) type and step size. For example, to run with the RK4 integrator and a 0.005 second step size, execute `./cloth_sim.exe r 0.005`
